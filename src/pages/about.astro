            Pedestrian Accident Lawyer is a free accident consultation service. We are NOT a law firm.
          </p>

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Pedestrian accidents are devastating. Victims often face catastrophic injuries, mounting medical bills, and a long road to recovery—all while insurance companies try to minimize their claims.</p>
        
        <p>We created Pedestrian Accident Lawyer to connect victims with experienced attorneys who understand the unique challenges pedestrians face. We're a consultation service that helps you find specialized legal representation at no cost to you. We're paid by the law firms in our network — you never pay us anything. Our network attorneys work on contingency—meaning you pay nothing unless you win.</p>

        <h2>Why Pedestrians Need Specialized Help</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>No Protection:</strong> Unlike car accident victims, pedestrians have no vehicle frame, airbags, or seatbelts. Injuries are almost always severe.</li>
          <li><strong>Blame Shifting:</strong> Insurance companies often try to blame pedestrians—claiming jaywalking, distraction, or failure to yield.</li>
          <li><strong>Complex Laws:</strong> Crosswalk laws, right-of-way rules, and fault systems vary dramatically by state.</li>
          <li><strong>High Stakes:</strong> Medical bills for pedestrian accidents often reach hundreds of thousands of dollars.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Our Commitment</h2>
        <p>We believe every pedestrian accident victim deserves access to quality legal representation, regardless of their financial situation. That's why our network attorneys work on contingency—no fees unless you win your case.</p>
